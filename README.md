# Practice-python-programming

Welcome to the **Practice Series of Python Programming from Basic and Advance**
Integer-float operations yield floats to maintain precision, while boolean values differ based on truthy/falsy criteria. Swapping and multi-variable assignments simplify code. Type conversions in `print()` enhance readability, though non-numeric strings raise errors. Rounding vs. truncating offers control, and dynamic type checks aid debugging.
